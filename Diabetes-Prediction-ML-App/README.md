# Diabetes Prediction Web App

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Web App repository! 

This project focuses on building a machine learning web application that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. The web app utilizes a trained machine learning model and provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their health parameters and receive a prediction.


## About the Project

The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that can assist individuals in understanding their risk of developing diabetes. By leveraging a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset, the web app provides an accurate prediction based on the user's input of various health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.


## Technologies Used

The Diabetes Prediction Web App is built using the following technologies:

- Python: The programming language used for the machine learning model training, web app backend, and data processing.
- Machine Learning: Various machine learning algorithms and techniques are applied to train the diabetes prediction model.
- Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library in Python used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library used for data preprocessing and handling.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing used for numerical operations and array processing.
- Streamlit: A Python library used for building interactive web applications with simple and intuitive interfaces.
- GitHub: A web-based hosting service for version control and repository management.
